# Mobile-Push-Menu

Firstly you need to create html like mine 
Add the small jquery file which you can find in js folder 

NOTE: You must have your all content in "wrapper" ID and add newmenu div just after the body tag all done. Your Cool Responsive Mobile Menu is ready to use and change styling as you want
